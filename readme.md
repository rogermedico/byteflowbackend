# The byte flow backend test

Module to perform bitcoin operations as shown in demo video.

## Installation and usage

1. Copy module files inside the modules folder of a Drupal 9 installation. For example inside web/modules/custom/bitcoinoperation.
2. Install module from admin panel.
3. Add your bitcoin operation nodes.

## Content type creation

The installation of the module also creates the content type, so you have to create nothing, just install and enjoy.

## Uninstall

If you uninstall the module, all the bitcoin operations will be deleted to avoid errors, as the content type bitcoin_operation is also removed.
